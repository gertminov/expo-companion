This repo holds the source code my the HCI-Project course at [JMU WÃ¼rzburg](https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/)
The ExpoCompanion is a tool for religious educators was developed to support them at an exhibition,
in reflecting on the use of interactive technologies in the field of teaching and learning about religious topics.
Through an iterative design process, the "ExpoCompanion" emerged. An app on an e-paper tablet that allows teachers to "reveal"
and answer questions stored on sheets with NFC tags.
The focus during development was on meeting the needs of stimulation, autonomy, and competence for the teachers.

[Pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io/) backend to handle the data storage. 
The Android app is written in kotlin using the [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) UI Framework
